# 🎮 Hangman Game Challenge

Build the classic word-guessing game using Python strings, loops, and user input.

## � What You'll Build

Create a Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts.

**Skills practiced:** String manipulation, loops, conditionals, random selection

## ✅ Must Have's

# 📘 Assignment: Hangman Game

## 🎯 Objective

Build a command-line Hangman game in Python to practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1 — Build the game

#### Description
Implement the core Hangman gameplay using the provided starter code. The program should run in the terminal and guide the player through guessing letters until they win or lose.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly choose a secret word from a predefined list
- Display the current word progress as underscores and revealed letters (e.g. `_ a _ _ m a n`)
- Accept single-letter guesses (case-insensitive) and ignore repeated guesses
- Track and display the number of incorrect attempts remaining
- End when the player guesses all letters (win) or runs out of attempts (loss)
- Show a clear win or lose message and reveal the secret word on loss

### 🛠️ Task 2 — Optional stretch goals

#### Description
Enhance the game with extra features for improved UX or additional practice.

#### Requirements (examples)

- Allow full-word guesses
- Add difficulty levels that change the word list or number of attempts
- Show simple ASCII art for the hangman state
- Persist high scores or save player stats to a file

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

- Practice string processing and list operations in Python
- Use loops and conditional logic to control game flow
- Work with user input and basic I/O
- Apply modular code organization and reuse starter code

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed
- Basic familiarity with running Python scripts from the command line

## 📁 Starter files

- `starter-code.py` — starter program with scaffolding and comments to help you begin

## ▶️ How to run

From this folder run:

```bash
python3 starter-code.py
```

Edit `starter-code.py` to implement features and test locally.

## ⏱️ Estimated time

60–90 minutes for the base implementation; extra time for stretch goals.

## ❓ Help & Submission

If you get stuck, ask for help describing the issue and showing relevant code snippets. Submit your final solution by sharing the completed `starter-code.py` file.
